For me, the terminal is of my most important tools, probably the most important tool. I use it to set up my programming environments, configure everything, start programs and handle and view data.\nYou can find my setup on this Github Repo: https://github.com/AndSt/zsh-config. I also use this directory to work on remote machine. In that way I can quickly setup new systems. As I want to make it compatible with Linux and Mac I\u0026rsquo;m still not fully happy. Recommendations are welcome! Right now I have two scripts, one for each system, installing programs such as VLC, Google Chrome and performing update commands such as apt upgrade. Afterwards I use VCSH combine with myrepos to set up my system. I used this guide to distribute the setup in the repo mentioned above to new systems.\nMost importantly I use ZSH. Using it provided me with a huge productivity boost. I like to keep my home directory tidy, so I use the XDG Base Directory specification to structure my home directory.\nPython Setup Since about 2.5 years Python is main programming language. On this note, I should note that I\u0026rsquo;m really happy and enjoy it to work with this language. Logically a big part of my setup is built for programming with Python\nI use virtualenv in combination with virtualenvwrapper to work on different projects. I favour it over other Python environment systems such as Anaconda as it is low level and easier compatible with pip. Surely there are other good choices, but so far it has met all my needs and there is no need to change.\nAdditionally I built some scripts to work with environments. For instance I built a command called \u0026ldquo;cvenv\u0026rdquo; which creates a new environment and installs some libraries I need in all my projects.\nI installed the virtualenvwrapper ZSH plugin. If a project repository is named like an existing environment, the plugin automically enters it.\nPlugins After googling and adding and removing some, I ended up using these plugins:\n git: Some git visualizations zsh-autosuggestions: Suggests previous commands in light gray virtualenvwrapper: Automatically enter python environments autojump: Learning system to jump to different parts of the system dotenv: If a .env file is present in a directory, it is automatically sourced zsh-syntax-highlighting: Beautifies terminal output  Out there\u0026rsquo;s really a lot of plugins. Check them out and pick together your favourite ones! Find them under here.\nFuture Plans There\u0026rsquo;s multiple ideas I have.\nSetup time: At the moment it still takes me one to two hours to set up my system. It\u0026rsquo;s definitely not perfect. My goal would be a a script which identifies the operating systems on it\u0026rsquo;s own and installs my standard setup. I know that there\u0026rsquo;s solutions such as Ansible. While I\u0026rsquo;ve not read a lot yet it feels like overengineering to use such sophisticated tool. Phone integration: Currently I use Mac for private usage. While there\u0026rsquo;s already a plethora of Desktop apps such as WhatsApp, Signal, Spotify etc. I wanna have some cool command line tools. For instance I would be able to move files from / to my phone using the terminal.\nResources In the end I wanna recommend some resources which helped me set up my system.\n I really enjoy the videos of Luke Smith. For example, in this video he shares how he keeps his home directory clean using the XDG Base Directory Specification. Awesome Dotfiles: Another awesome library. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested to know more about Dotfiles, this should be a good entry point to find interesting resources.

Within this paragraph I will give a high level view which lacks completeness and any formal correctness . The goal is to give you an intuitive idea how I see the field. Given my machine learning background, my limited exposure to the field, chances are that my introduction is not the best for everyone. If you leave this intro with a feeling of some questions Causal Inference aims to answer, I\u0026rsquo;d be really happy ü•≥. Now let\u0026rsquo;s get down to business.\nCausal thinking is something very natural to humans. A child easily understands the causal relationship between falling down and the pain it creates. Falling is the cause and pain is the effect. One goal of Causal Inference is to mathematically formalize this thinking.\nThere are many examples which show that the traditional statistical language, which is based on the notion of independence, is incapable to describe these relationships. A famous saying hereto is association is not causation which is described by Simpson\u0026rsquo;s Paradox. A traditional example is the UC Berkeley gender bias case. In total, the numbers showed that UCB was biased to admit more men. But a closer inspection showed that woman often applied to more competitive degrees where more people were rejected. Thus in total the trend was not that clear. The example shows that a statistical fact doesn\u0026rsquo;t describe the cause and effect of the underlying process. Here, in the language of Causal Inference - more later -, a so called confounding variable (the degree program) conflicted with standard statistics.\nNow I want to give a tiny intro into the mathematical modelling. Causal Inference assumes operates on so called Strucural Causal Models (SCM), often also called Structural Equation Model (SEM), which generates a causal graph.\nA SCM $C := (S, N)$ governing the random vector $X = (X1, . . . , Xd)$ is a set of structural equations: $S_i: X_i \\leftarrow fi(Pa(X_i), N_i)$, where $Pa(Xi) ‚äÜ {X_1, . . . , X_d} \\ {X_i}$ are called the parents of Xi, and the $N_i$ are independent noise random variables. We say that ‚Äú$X_i$ causes $X_j$‚Äù if $X_i ‚àà Pa(X_j)$. We call a graph $G$ a causal graph of $X$ if it is obtained by drawing i) one node for each $X_i$, and ii) one edge from $X_i$ to $X_j$ if $X_i ‚àà Pa(X_j)$. We assume acyclic causal graphs. Definition is taken from [1]. Various abstractions, including cyclic graphs are also possible, e.g. [2].\nOne task is to observe SCM\u0026rsquo;s or causal graphs from observational data. Most of the time we assume they are given by human domain knowledge. To answer causal questions humans resort to \u0026ldquo;What if\u0026rdquo; questions, e.g. \u0026ldquo;Would it have been smarter if I had used the bike instead of the car\u0026rdquo;. This is formalized by interventions. Again we take the definition from [1]:\nConsider a SEM C = (S, N). An intervention $e$ on $C$ consists of replacing one or several of its structural equations to obtain an intervened SEM $C^e=(S^e, N^e)$, with structural equations: $S_i^e : X_i \\leftarrow f_i^e (Pa^e(X_i^e), N_i^e)$,.\nThe variable $X_e$ is intervened if $S_i \\neq S_i^e$ or $N_i \\neq N_i^e$.\nA hard intervention would set a value $X_i$ to a specific value, e.g. man or woman. A soft intervention would change the formula. By doing so we can answer \u0026ldquo;What if\u0026rdquo; questions.\nIn the end, I want to talk about Pearl\u0026rsquo;s ladder of Causal inference. I hope this gives some high level insight into the types of questions Causal Inference aims to answer.\nHow did I learn it? While I heard about the field and the famous saying \u0026ldquo;Causation is not equal to Correlation\u0026rdquo;, I just started diving into the topic this January. With a good friend we went through the course by Brady Neal (Link to course). I really enjoyed learning the theory here. It establishes the philosophical thoughts and basic assumptions on the basis of easy examples. It\u0026rsquo;s important to note that the course doesn\u0026rsquo;t focus on the relation to machine learning but gives a general introduction to the topic. In my view this is necessary to get a comprehensive introduction.\nTODO: compare to primer and sch√∂lkopf book.\nWhat connections did I observe to NLP? On the first sight, causal thinking is completely natural to human thinking. We make statistical and causal considerations in most of our arguments. #TODO good example But when you want to apply the theory to certain problems, often complexity rises to quickly. Most problems in causal inference assume a known causal graph. In language, every conversation can be represented by a different graph. This is an example of the complexity arising.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s different ways how Causal Inference interacts with machine learning in general. A good overview is given in TODO: Sch√∂lkopf paper\ngithu causaltext link An idea is to use CI for model explainability. A very nice example is CausaLM\nWhat problems do I see?
