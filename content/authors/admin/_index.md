HI! I'm Andy, a PhD student at the Digital Text Sciences group led by Professor Benjamin Roth. The group is located within the data mining group at the University of Vienna. Within my research I investigate how we can use multiple noisy / weak signals to support or guide learning algorithms. Instances are labeling functions, i.e. code which labels data, image-2-text models, i.e. incomplete descriptions of images, or multiple LLM generations.
Beforehand, I spent two years in industry working on applied NLP problems such as information extraction or integration of graphs and text.
