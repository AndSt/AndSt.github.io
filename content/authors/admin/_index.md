Hey! My name is Andy, and I am currently pursuing a PhD with the Digital Text Sciences group under the leadership of [Professor Benjamin Roth](https://benjaminroth.net/) at the University of Vienna. The group is part of the larger [Research Group Data Mining and Machine Learning](https://dm.cs.univie.ac.at/). 
Prior to my academic engagement, I spent two years in the industry, tackling applied natural language processing (NLP) challenges, including information extraction and the integration of graphs with textual data.
My research focuses on leveraging various noisy or weak signals to enhance or direct learning algorithms. This includes working with labeling functions—code that annotates data, image-to-text models providing imperfect descriptions of images, and outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs).
