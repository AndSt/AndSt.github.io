HI! I'm Andy, a PhD student at the Digital Text Sciences group led by Professor Benjamin Roth. The group is located within the data mining group at the University of Vienna. Within my research I want to investigate how to use available human intuitions and heuristics to guide learning algorithms. Most recently, I move my focus to thinking about how to transfer ideas from weak supervision to generative language models.
Beforehand, I spent two years in industry working on NLP tasks. First, as a working student at BMW, applying NLP to multiple automotive use cases, and then at Check24 working on various information extraction and classification tasks within the financial and insurance domains.
